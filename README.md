# Cramer-s_rule
Solving [3_Equation_system] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations)based on [Cramer's_rule in 3*3 matrices] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule#Applications)with a little time complexity optimization.

I'm new, so this is not the best code, feel free to improve it.
